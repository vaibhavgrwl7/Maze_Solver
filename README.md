# Maze_Solver
Solving a maze 
The idea here is to write a program to solve simple mazes. The mazes are given in 
a file and the program must read in the file, solve the maze and output the solution. 
If no solution is possible the output should indicate this somehow. 
The program should be written to the following specification:  Arbitrary sized mazes should be handled  Valid moves are N, S, E, W (not diagonally)  All input will be clean, no validation is necessary  The maze file format is described below with an example  The program should be tested on the sample mazes provided (these all have a 
valid solution).  Output should be written to the Standard Output/Console  If no solution is possible the output should indicate this somehow 
The emphasis should be on code readability and simplicity with a runtime for all the 
sample mazes below 30 seconds.
